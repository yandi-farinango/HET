# HET Case Study 
## Instructions 
"This is an unstructured exercise that will be used to evaluate your critical thinking, problem solving, analytic, and data mining skills. 

The data housed in this workbook is 12 months of Member-level (read: Patient level) cost/utilization/diagnosis metrics for one of BCBSILs clients. 

The ultimate goal is to use the 'Client Membership', 'Client Data', & 'Benchmark Data' Tabs to craft a deliverable to your client. 

How you choose to structure that presentation is entirely up to you. There are no wrong answers and any findings you conclude are perfectly acceptable. 

The expectation is that you will leverage any/all resources available to you to help analyze the data and organize your findings in such a way that is presentation friendly. 

You will have 48 hours to complete this exercise. All materials used are due by 9am on the 2nd day post receipt (if received on Friday, 9am -- submission is expected to be Sunday, 9am) to Todd_Peden@bcbsil.com. At which point, a 30 minute conference call will be scheduled with the Health Economics Team in order for you to present your material and walk through your approach. 

Below you will find a data dictionary and a metric 'cheat sheet' designed to aid you in the process. Feel free to email Todd Peden, Director of the Health Economics Team, at the above email address with any questions that you may have throughout this exercise. "
